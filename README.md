## Overview

[3-Column Preview Card Component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj/hub)

In this challenge, we had to create a 3 column card component to make it look at close as the given images.

For this project, I built it with these:

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Based off the last few challenges, I have learnt how to properly align my items horizontally, and also tried my best to make the HTML as semantic as it can possibly be. Where I spent quite a few minutes on is on the vertical alignment. What helped for me was this piece of code below:

```
body {
...
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
...
}
```

The code above allowed me to vertically align all of my content (both main, and also the footer). Overall, I'm happy with my progress in learning HTML and CSS. I actually thought I was dumb this morning but I managed to complete this!
